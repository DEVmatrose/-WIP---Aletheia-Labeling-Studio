I've analyzed our spending from Q3 and I suggest we allocate 30% to marketing initiatives, especially social media campaigns. Our conversion rates from those channels are up 45%.\n\nCharlie: That sounds reasonable, but I think we should keep a 20% buffer for unexpected costs. Last quarter we had some infrastructure issues that weren't budgeted.\n\nAlice: Good point Charlie. Let's go with 30% marketing, 20% buffer, and the rest split between operations and development. Can someone draft this for approval?\n\nBob: I'll do it and send it to the team by Friday.\n\nAlice: Perfect. Any other topics? ... Okay, let's wrap up. Thanks everyone!",
